A replication of the paper [Improving Language Understanding by Generatative Pre-Training](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf).

Note that I use kaparthy's [tiny-shakespeare](https://huggingface.co/datasets/karpathy/tiny_shakespeare) and character level encoding.
